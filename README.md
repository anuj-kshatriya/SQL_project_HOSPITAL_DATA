# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis using SQL  

## 📂 Database & Tables  
The project is structured around a **Hospital** database with a key table:  
- **Hospital_data** 🏨: Stores details of hospitals, departments, doctors, patients, medical expenses, and admissions/discharges.  

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Insights  
✅ **Total Patient Count** – Finding the total number of patients treated.  
✅ **Average Number of Doctors per Hospital** – Understanding staffing levels.  
✅ **Top 3 Departments with the Most Patients** – Identifying high-demand medical specialties.  
✅ **Hospital with the Maximum Medical Expenses** – Finding cost-intensive hospitals.  
✅ **Daily Average Medical Expenses** – Analyzing hospital spending efficiency.  
✅ **Longest Hospital Stay** – Identifying cases with extended patient stays.  
✅ **Total Patients Treated Per City** – Mapping healthcare demand by location.  
✅ **Average Length of Stay Per Department** – Understanding hospital resource utilization.  
✅ **Department with the Lowest Patient Count** – Finding underutilized specialties.  
✅ **Monthly Medical Expenses Report** – Analyzing hospital costs on a monthly basis.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** for data querying and analysis.  
- **Aggregate functions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and JOINS** for extracting insights.  
- **Date functions** for calculating stay durations and monthly expenses.  

## 📊 Future Enhancements  
- Introduce **predictive analytics** for hospital admissions.  
- Implement **performance metrics** for hospital efficiency evaluation.  
- Create **interactive dashboards** for visualizing key insights.  

This project is ideal for learning **SQL-based data analysis in the healthcare domain**, providing valuable business and operational insights for hospitals! 🚀
